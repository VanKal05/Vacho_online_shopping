= COMPATIBILITY WITH MOST USED PLUGINS/ADDONS  =
We understand that our plugin is not the only one you'll use for your WooCommerce store and that it's important for different plugins to work well with each other. That's why we've ensured compatibility with the most used WooCommerce add-ons: [WooCommerce Bookings](https://woocommerce.com/products/woocommerce-bookings/?aff=3955), [WooCommerce Subscriptions](https://woocommerce.com/products/woocommerce-subscriptions/?aff=3955), [WooCommerce Composite Products](https://woocommerce.com/products/composite-products/?aff=3955), [WooCommerce Product Bundles](https://woocommerce.com/products/product-bundles/?aff=3955), [WooCommerce Mix and Match](https://woocommerce.com/products/woocommerce-mix-and-match-products/?aff=3955), [WooCommerce Gravity Forms Product Add-Ons](https://woocommerce.com/products/gravity-forms-add-ons/?aff=3955), [WooCommerce Gift Cards](https://wordpress.org/plugins/gift-cards-for-woocommerce/), [WooCommerce TM Extra Product Options](https://codecanyon.net/item/woocommerce-extra-product-options/7908619), and [WooCommerce Product Add-ons](https://woocommerce.com/products/product-add-ons/?aff=3955).
It's also essential for any WordPress website to use cache plugins, so we've made sure that our WooCommerce Wishlist works well with popular caching plugins such as [WP Rocket](https://wp-rocket.me/), [WP Super Cache](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-super-cache/), and [W3 Total Cache](https://wordpress.org/plugins/w3-total-cache/).

= Add to Wishlist button =
You can customize the Add to Wishlist button settings to make it work best for your website. Make it a link or a button, choose from predefined icons or upload your own. Select a predefined button position or place it wherever you want using the shortcode.

= Customizable Wishlist table =
You can show or hide any column in the Wishlist table on the Wishlist page. This allows you to decide what information to show and what to omit. Make your Wishlist page as informative or simple as you want.

= Make it fit your website perfectly =
TI WooCommerce Wishlist comes with over 60 appearance options such as colors, font size, and borders, allowing you to tailor it to your website's design. And if that's not enough, you can add your custom CSS styles directly in the admin panel.

= Translation Ready =
TI WooCommerce Wishlist is translation-ready, making it easy to translate into any language. You can use the poEdit tool, [Loco Translate](https://wordpress.org/plugins/loco-translate/), [WP Multilang](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-multilang/), or [WPML](https://wpml.org/?aid=9393&affiliate_key=9xzbMQnIyxHE) to translate the plugin.

= Responsive =
We understand the importance of responsive websites for online stores. That's why we made sure that TI WooCommerce Wishlist looks and works perfectly on any device and that the layouts are user-friendly. You can check out the screenshots or preview to see for yourself.
